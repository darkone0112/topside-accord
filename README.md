# The A.C.C.O.R.D.: A Guide to Collaboration and Survival Topside

>When chaos rules the surface, a few of us still believe in something else. A signal, a gesture, a choice not to shoot. That’s what the Topside Accord stands for.

----
## What is the ACCORD?

The **ACCORD** is not a clan, a faction, or a rulebook.  
It’s a set of beliefs; a signal shared between raiders who choose not to shoot on sight.  
It’s the idea that maybe, just maybe, we don’t *always* have to follow the violent path the moment we see another Speranza-dweller across the field.

The **Topside** is brutal. It’s broken.  
And yes; **fights will happen**. They must. That’s the nature of man, and the nature of survival.  
But even in chaos, there can be *decency*. A moment of pause.

We’re all here for the same reason:  
To gather, to extract, to survive one more raid.  
There’s more than enough loot to go around, and when we tear each other apart, we only make the Arcs’ job easier.

**Alone, we bleed out in the dirt.  
Together, we have a chance.**
### A -- Approach with Intent
-------
> The way you show up sets the tone.

- Take the initiative. Don’t lurk and hope they notice you; step out and make yourself known.
- Don’t sprint directly at someone unless you're ready to get shot in the face.
- Walk slowly, with your weapon in hand but do not aim, keep the muzzle relaxed but present.
- Ensure you are not at a disvantageous position before making any contact
- Choose a readable path: approach from the front or a clear angle, not from cover or behind.
- Pause once visible. A brief stop signals control and lets them process you.
- Keep your movement smooth and predictable; avoid sudden turns, slides, or zigzags.

**--> Principle:** Visibility is vulnerability. Offer it first, on your terms.

### Edge cases during approach

- Do not attempt a friendly approach while being shot at. You are already in combat.
    
- If they notice you first and open fire, fight back while moving to cover. Only attempt to de-escalate once you’ve stabilized the situation and have options.
    
- If you’re ambushed, assume talking won’t save you. You can try, but expect it to be risky and act accordingly (smoke, retreat path, break LOS).

## C -- Communicate First
-----
> Words save lives. Silence ends them.

- Greet first and keep it short: “Hello raider,” “Peace,” “Not hostile.”
- Speak early; start as you step into view, not at face-to-face range.
- Keep tone calm and even; short sentences read as control, not bait.
- Say your intent once, then pause and listen.
- If they answer, mirror a key word back to confirm (“Peace?” → “Peace.”)

-->Principle: say less, say early, then listen.
### Edge cases during communication

- No response: restate once, clearer and slower, then treat the encounter as uncertain.
    
- No feedback after multiple clear attempts: treat the encounter at your discretion. Assume uncertainty; hold distance, reposition, or disengage.
    
- VOIP failure or mic-less: try the game’s voice cues, but understand this is riskier. Rely on clear visual signals and avoid closing distance until intent is mutual.
### First close contact (after communication is established)

- Call “clean hands” before closing. Both sides stow weapons on the back.
    
- If either side won’t or can’t stow, treat the encounter as uncertain and keep distance.
    
- Close slowly to a readable range (about 5-7 meters), then stop.
    
- No looting or body checks during first contact.

>Use VOIP. Use in-game cues. Say "hello, raider"; or anything. Silence kills faster than bullets.

## C -- Create Space
----
> Trust needs air between it.

- Keep your distance during first approach; about 5-10 meters gives both sides room to breathe.
- Avoid running straight in after communication starts. Approach halfway, then stop. Let them close the rest.
- Keep clear of their flanks and rear; staying in view builds trust.
- If multiple raiders are with you, spread out. One voice, one speaker; the rest hold visible positions and stay still.
- Do not stand directly over loot, bodies, or extraction points during early talks. It reads as greed or bait.
- If the other side backs up, mirror it. Space is language; match their pace.

-->Principle: no pressure, no panic.

### Edge cases during spacing

- Tight areas: step aside, gesture them past, or relocate to open ground before re-engaging.
    
- Third-party threat: try to reach an agreement quickly. Fighting side-by-side is easier than guessing.
    
- Always maintain line of sight unless explicitly safe.
    
- Never rush or close distance with a raider who is fighting Arcs unless an agreement has been made. Keep your presence visible, but your space respectful.

Maintain visible separation until mutual comfort is clear; distance is the first sign of respect.

### **Once mutual peace is reached, move together, not tangled**

- Maintain 5-10 meters of spacing at all times. Close enough to help, far enough to feel safe.
    
- Mirror their path and speed. Avoid following directly behind unless terrain requires it.
    
- Take a moment to identify your ally’s look; outfit, helmet, colors, weapons, to prevent friendly fire.
    
- Establish basic roles: who lead the way, who watches flank. If unclear, speak up early.
    
- Announce sudden movements: “Flanking left,” “Jumping down,” “Taking roof.”

>**Space is trust made visible, keep it, and you keep the peace alive.**

## O -- Observe Reactions
----
> Peace isn’t agreed upon, it’s felt.

- Watch how they move the moment you become visible. Freeze? Strafe? Aim? It all means something.
- If they don’t respond verbally, look for pacing, crouch taps, or body turns; hesitation is often safer than silence.
- If they ADS but don’t fire, hold position and speak again.
- If they keep you in their periphery, they’re probably prepping for betrayal, proceed carefully.
- Match their tempo: if they slow down, don’t rush. If they rotate, mirror at a distance.

-->**Principle:** actions speak before words, read the body.

### **Edge cases while observing**

- Nervous movement (circling, micro-strafing, twitchy aim) can signal uncertainty, not aggression.
    
- Silent stares with no signal: treat as undecided or passive-hostile. Move slow, talk once more, then disengage.
    
- If they test your reactions (push close, fake shot, partial peek), it’s either mistrust or bait. Respond once, then reposition.

### **Keep watching even after peace is reached**

- Observe changes in posture if loot drops, combat ends, or another player appears.
    
- If your ally starts shifting behavior, silent, unresponsive, hovering loot; prepare to disengage.
    
- Even under the Accord, behavior can shift. Trust but verify.

>Peace is fragile, body language is loud. Stay sharp; you’re still reading a stranger.

## R -- Respond with Consistency
---
> Trust isn’t promised; it’s patterned.

- Once you’ve established peace, stick to it. Don’t change behavior without a reason.
- If you were calm, stay calm. If you were vocal, stay vocal. Don’t suddenly go silent.
- Keep your spacing, comms, and body language steady. Predictability builds safety.
- Don’t bait. Don’t test. Don’t bluff. If you say “Wanna Team up,” live it.
- Signal intent before changing behavior
    
-->**Principle:** your consistency is your credibility.

**Edge cases during consistency**

- Momentary silence (mic cut, distraction or any funny behavior) should be followed with a quick “Still good” or the "Wanna Team Up" cue
    
- If your ally starts acting erratic, stay composed, don’t mirror their panic unless you confirm the threat.
    
- In group movement, don’t go rogue.
    
- If you have to break the Accord; due to betrayal or survival, make it clear. Back up first. Voice your shift. Let them see it coming.
    

>**Consistency is how you become known. You are your pattern. Make it mean something.**

## D -- De-escalate or Disengage

> Not every encounter leads to peace; but not every one needs to end in blood.

- If signals are unclear or mistrust builds, back off early. Distance creates options.
- Don’t force peace. If they won’t respond or mirror your signals, extract yourself.
- If things shift ; new raiders arrive, tension rises, they stop talking, narrate your next action and create space.
- Don’t linger after a failed attempt. Hovering in silence is a threat.
- If shot at while disengaging, return fire, but still aim to break line of sight to get a better position 

**Principle:** survival is the goal, not the kill, not the ego.

**Edge cases during disengagement**

- If chased after disengaging, assume hostility and defend yourself.
    
- If they suddenly offer peace after aggression, be cautious. De-escalation is fragile after first blood.
    
- If you're the one misread as hostile, stop, call it out, and slowly disengage to reset. Try again from distance.
    

>**Not every encounter becomes a story. Sometimes the smartest choice is to walk away.**

-----------------------------------
## On flexibility and judgment

The ACCORD is not carved in stone. It’s a set of good practices, not a script. Encounters with strangers are chaotic and unpredictable; you will need to mix and adapt these ideas in real time.

Use this guide to shape your intent, then read the moment:
- Prioritize safety. If the situation turns, protect yourself first.
- Principles over steps. Don’t follow a checklist when the scene doesn’t fit it.
- Exceptions happen. Terrain, third parties, and objectives can override the ideal approach.
- Communicate clearly, but don’t force it. If it isn’t landing, change the plan.
- Be consistent when possible, but not rigid. Adapt without becoming unpredictable.

>Treat the ACCORD like a compass, not a roadmap.

-------------------------------------------------------
## On accountability and scope

The ACCORD is voluntary. It does not police or punish. It only exists between raiders who choose to honor it.

Any raider is free to shoot on sight. Raiders who follow the ACCORD, however, are expected to:
- signal intent quickly,
- establish terms of peace fast (or disengage), and
- act consistently with the guide.

Failure to show clear intent will be read as hostility. If you appear to stall, bait, or fish for advantage, you will be treated as a threat.

Trust your gut. If something feels wrong, protect yourself first.

-----------
## On betrayal and resolve

The ACCORD is not a warranty of loyalty between strangers. Betrayals are possible and they will happen.

Distinctions
- Hostile raiders: never claimed the ACCORD; they are outside its scope.
- Traitors: pretended to follow the ACCORD and then broke it.

Community stance
- Traitors should be called out publicly with clear evidence, so ACCORD-compliant raiders can stay informed.
- Keep it factual. No harassment or dogpiling; the goal is awareness, not vengeance.

Your response
- Do not let a traitor’s choice undermine your resolve. Hold to the ACCORD.
- Do not bring vengeance upon unrelated raiders for past wounds.
- Protect yourself first, break contact, and extract if needed. Learn and adapt.

Personal standard
- Maintain your conduct even when others do not.
- We all reap what we sow. Let your pattern speak for you.


>The Accord is not a rulebook. It's a handshake.  
>Not everyone will take it; but some will.  
And that’s enough to change a fight into a moment.
